It&#x27;s in big letters on my homepage. If you want credible and compelling content about blockchain technology, you can email me at <a href="mailto:thomas@tdmoor.com">thomas@tdmoor.com</a> or DM me on <a href="https://twitter.com/ThDeM" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. But the homepage doesn&#x27;t really say much about me, does it? Well, keep on reading.<br/></p><h2>A Thought That Didn&#x27;t Leave</h2><p class="left-paragraph">Have you ever had a thought that stayed with you for years on end? Here was mine: “I want to be a writer.” It popped into my head when I was very young and never went away. I didn&#x27;t know what to do with it. Sure, I wrote blogs, short stories, and I was good with languages in general, but I was also interested in many other things – technology in particular. And how was I ever gonna earn money writing?<br/><br/>So I did nothing with the thought. I suppressed it, pretended that it didn&#x27;t exist, that it wasn&#x27;t always lurking underneath the surface of my conscious mind. Instead, I traveled the world for my studies, learned how to play the guitar, and worked in London as a SaaS salesman for five years. A good life, but the thought did not leave.<br/></p><h2>Writing for the Metaverse</h2><p class="left-paragraph">Meanwhile, I saw the impact of the Internet on our society. What started as a place to send information back and forth was growing into something so intricate and interconnected it would become an inherent part of our daily lives. I saw the birth of the Metaverse, the convergence of the real with the digital, and it suddenly dawned on me. That place will need content.<br/><br/>I saw the path. Less than a week after this realization, I quit my job and was browsing for freelance writing opportunities on Upwork (okay, <a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01d0550e03ea5a72cf" target="_blank">here&#x27;s my old profile</a>). Six months later, I was earning over $5,000 per month writing content for several tech companies. All remote, too. The sweet taste of geographical independence.<br/></p><div class="testimonial-wrapper"><blockquote class="block-quote"><em>Thomas is a great writer who can turn difficult topics into understandable articles. He wrote articles about AI for us and did a great job. Furthermore, he is a joy to work with, has a clear communication style and adheres to deadlines.<br/>‍<br/>- Joanne Zhang, Marketing</em></blockquote></div><p class="left-paragraph">But I was scattered. I wrote for VR agencies, AI start-ups, cybersecurity companies, and others. While the work was always interesting and engaging, I felt that I could be of better use if I niched down into the technology I believe had the potential to change the world most.<br/><br/>The answer was obvious. Just like TCP/IP became the foundation of the Internet, I could see blockchain technology become the foundation of the Metaverse. Its potential is enormous. It can connect the underbanked, improve data security, speed up money transfers, reduce electoral fraud, <a href="https://tdmoor.com/blog/asset-ownership-digital-future">give value to digital assets</a>, and much more. I realized I could make a positive impact on the world by writing great content for blockchain companies. So I became a blockchain marketer.<br/><br/>Want to know more?
