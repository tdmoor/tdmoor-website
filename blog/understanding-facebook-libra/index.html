        <p>Money is a social construct. Societies around the world have agreed that money would be the primary mechanism
          to use for transferring value between people. If it weren’t for that agreement, cash would just be paper, a
          credit card a piece of plastic, a bank account a useless number. </p>
        <p>Because money is a social construct, we’ve been able to abstract it away. The dollar hasn’t been tied to gold
          for decades and digitization means we’re moving to cashless societies. Money now moves digitally, invisibly.
          When the US government says <a
            href="https://www.npr.org/2020/03/26/821457551/whats-inside-the-senate-s-2-trillion-coronavirus-aid-package"
            target="_blank">they’ll print $2 trillion</a>, they won’t actually print $2 trillion physical dollar bills.
          Someone in the Federal Reserve will just increase the number on their balance sheets. Poof, money.</p>
        <p>Those who can print the money have the power. So, when Facebook came out with plans to launch its own
          cryptocurrency in June 2019, governments and central banks around the world reacted with horror, terror, and
          <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-16/facebook-gets-sharp-questions-as-senators-tee-off-on-crypto-plan"
            target="_blank">Senate hearings</a>. This is Facebook’s attempt to take even more, we heard. Facebook is
          trying something that will destabilize society, we heard. This is dangerous and should be stopped, we heard.
        </p>
        <p>But sensationalist headlines only ever scratch the surface of a topic. I wanted to understand what Libra
          actually is. What is its mission, how does it work, and how is Facebook involved in the project? I dug deep
          into the <a href="https://libra.org/en-US/white-paper/" target="_blank">official Libra white paper</a>,
          Libra’s <a href="https://developers.libra.org/docs/welcome-to-libra" target="_blank">developer
            documentation</a>, and other, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/libras-biggest-problem" target="_blank">more
            critical sources</a> to figure this all out. Here’s what I found.</p>
        <h2>Why Does Libra Exist?</h2>
        <p>Libra wants to “enable a global payment system &amp; financial infrastructure to empower billions of
          people.&quot; They particularly focus on those who either don’t have access to financial services (the
          unbanked) or those who have limited access to financial services (the underbanked). <br /></p>
        <p>Today’s banking system is expensive for the poor. While a $5 remittance fee might mean nothing to someone
          sending across $1 million, it’s incredibly painful for the factory worker sending across $20 to his family
          abroad.<br /></p>
        <p>Additionally, billions of people simply don’t live in an area where they have physical access to a bank. A
          Berber in the Sahara desert or a sheepherder in the Himalayas is unlikely to ever come across the regional
          equivalent of an HSBC.<br /></p>

          <figcaption><em>Follow your nose to the closest bank</em>‍</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>However, there’s a good chance that these people have a phone connected to the Internet. A financial system
          built with <a href="https://tdmoor.com/blog/understanding-blockchain-technology" target="_blank">blockchain
            technology</a> means, theoretically, that anyone with an Internet connection can participate. Libra wants to
          be that financial system. It wants to combine blockchain technology with accepted, regulatory financial
          frameworks to reduce the cost of the banking system and make it more inclusive.<strong>‍</strong></p>
        <h2><strong>Who’s in Charge?</strong></h2>
        <p>Contrary to popular opinion, Facebook is not in charge of Libra. They came up with the idea and built a large
          chunk of the technology behind Libra, so they definitely want to see the project succeed, but they have no
          disproportionate voting power to account for this. I only chose the title “Understanding Facebook’s Libra”
          because Libra in itself doesn’t have enough brand power yet for everyone to immediately understand what the
          article was about. But there is no such thing as a “Facebook Libra”. Instead, Libra is owned by the Libra
          Association.<br /></p>
        <p>The <a href="https://libra.org/en-US/association/#the_members" target="_blank">Libra Association</a> is a
          not-for-profit membership organization based in Geneva, Switzerland. It’s responsible for the development of
          the Libra project and for providing decision-making frameworks for the Libra Network and Reserve (more on them
          later). Members of the Association include Shopify, Farfetch, Coinbase, Spotify, Uber, etc. It’s a growing
          list of companies from a wide variety of industries.<br /></p>
        <p>It’s not easy to become a Libra Association member. If you’re a for-profit company, you need to invest at
          least $10 million, have a market cap of more than $1 billion, reach more than 20 million people a year, and be
          recognized as an established top-100 industry leader. You also need to run a validator node to process
          transactions on the Libra blockchain, which can cost a few hundred thousand dollars a year.<br /></p>
        <p>In exchange, you get one vote or 1% of the vote (whichever is larger) in the Association’s Council and the
          equivalent of the money you’ve invested in Libra Investment Tokens. Your share of the tokens will translate
          into the proportion of the dividend you’ll receive from the interest of the assets in the Libra Reserve. So
          the more you invest, the higher your proportion of the dividend and the more money you’ll earn if Libra
          succeeds.</p>
        <h2><strong>How Does it Work?</strong></h2>
        <p>Now that we know who’s in charge, let’s examine how Libra works. The Libra Association owns Libra Networks,
          which is responsible for minting and burning Libra Coins, administering the Libra Reserve, and for operating
          the Libra payment system that runs on the Libra Blockchain. Let’s go over each of these elements in turn.</p>
        <h3>Understanding Libra Coins</h3>
        <p>When Facebook launched the Libra project in June 2019, they intended to run only one cryptocurrency on the
          Libra blockchain: the Libra Coin (abbreviated as ≋LBR). It was meant to be a cryptocurrency with low
          volatility that people can use to settle transactions across borders. </p>
        <p>Sending 20 ≋LBR to your family abroad across the Libra Blockchain would be fast and very cheap, and your
          family could then convert it to their local currency to spend on goods and services.<br /></p>
        <p>One of the reasons why Libra faced such strong opposition is because countries were afraid Libra could
          interfere with their monetary sovereignty. They were afraid of a scenario where a majority of people would
          only use ≋LBR for everything instead of their local currency. So, after many months of deliberation, Libra
          backed down. As announced in the second edition of their white paper, ≋LBR will no longer be the only
          cryptocurrency on the Libra Blockchain. Instead, they will also include single-currency stablecoins, starting
          with LibraUSD, LibraEUR, LibraGBP, and LibraSGD. <br /></p>
        <p><em>Brief explainer: stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the currency they represent. For
            example, LibraUSD is a stablecoin of the US dollar. 1 LibraUSD can be converted to almost exactly $1.
            Stablecoins are one of the fastest-growing areas of the cryptocurrency industry.</em><br /></p>
        <p>All the cryptocurrencies on the Libra Blockchain are called Libra Coins. Libra Networks is responsible for
          minting and burning them, which will happen in response to the market demand of that particular coin. <br />
        </p>
        <p>While Libra will still control the single-currency stablecoins running on their blockchain , they say in
          their white paper that they want countries to directly integrate their Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)
          into the Libra network. If the US created its own CBDC and wanted to integrate that into the Libra Blockchain,
          Libra would remove the LibraUSD in exchange for that currency. <br /></p>
        <p>So all Libra Coins are stablecoins. Their price will not fluctuate like the price of Bitcoin or Ethereum,
          which makes a Libra Coin a much more trustworthy currency to use as money. But how will Libra keep the prices
          of its coins relatively stable? That’s where the Libra Reserve comes in.</p>
        <h3>Understanding the Libra Reserve</h3>
        <p>The Libra Reserve must hold an amount of money at least equal to the face value of each Libra Coin in
          circulation, either in cash or cash equivalents. Compare that to traditional banks, which only need to hold a
          fractional reserve (or <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reservereq.htm"
            target="_blank">nothing at all</a>, as per recent developments in the US). 80% of Libra’s Reserve will
          consist of short-term government securities with low credit risk while 20% will be held in cash.<br /></p>
        <p>If those assets yield a negative return, the Reserve will make up for it through other revenue streams, such
          as the transaction fees of the Libra Blockchain. It will use positive returns to pay for its operating
          expenses and to return a dividend to the members of the Libra Association (remember those Libra Investment
          Tokens? That’s what they’re for). <br /></p>
        <p>To further spread the risks of shocks to the system, the assets of the Reserve will be held by a
          geographically distributed network of well-capitalized banks. There will also be an additional capital buffer
          to absorb unexpected losses. All this to make sure that 1 ≋LBR (or any other Libra Coin) keeps its value over
          time and doesn’t fluctuate as crazily as regular cryptocurrencies do.</p>
        <h3>Understanding the Libra Blockchain</h3>
        <p>One of the biggest problems of today’s cryptocurrencies is speed. Bitcoin, for example, can only process
          about 7 transactions per second (TPS). Compare that to traditional payment provider Visa, which can handle
          24,000 TPS on their network. <br /></p>
        <p>If you want to build a cryptocurrency that billions of people can use without friction, it needs to be fast,
          efficient, secure, and flexible. That’s why the Libra Blockchain runs on an entirely new programming language
          called <a href="https://developers.libra.org/docs/move-overview" target="_blank">Move</a>. Developers can use
          Move to implement transaction logic and smart contracts on the Libra Blockchain, although, at first, only
          Association-approved and -published smart contracts will be able to interact directly with the Libra payment
          system.<br /></p>
        <p>The Libra Blockchain is built in such a way that it can process approximately 1,000 TPS. This is in part
          because of its consensus mechanism. Libra does not rely on Proof of Work, like Bitcoin does, because it’s slow
          and bad for the climate (it consumes <a href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption"
            target="_blank">lots of electricity</a>). Instead, it relies on the validator nodes of Association members
          to confirm transactions.<br /></p>
        <p>Without going into too much technical detail, the actual consensus mechanism is called LibraBFT and is based
          on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05069">HotStuff consensus protocol</a>. Contrary to a “traditional”
          blockchain, the Libra Blockchain is not separated into blocks of transactions. Instead, it’s an ever-growing
          Merkle tree where each newly executed transaction is a new leaf on the tree.</p>
        <h3>Permissioned vs Permissionless</h3>
        <p>Blockchain purists reading this article will by now be seething with rage. After all, transactions on the
          Libra Blockchain are approved by validator nodes of Libra Association Members, an exclusive club of wealthy
          companies. It is a permissioned blockchain. This goes directly against one of the central tenets of blockchain
          technology: removing the middleman and returning power to the people.<br /></p>
        <p>Unfortunately, as of right now, no blockchain exists that is <em>both </em>permissionless <em>and</em> fast
          enough to confirm hundreds, if not thousands of transactions per second. This being said, Libra intends to
          eventually allow new entrants to run independent validator nodes that will increase the security and the
          reliability of the network. <br /></p>
        <p>They will also eventually allow new entrants to build payments and financial services on the Libra blockchain
          for businesses and consumers, as well as allow them to actively participate in the governance and evolution of
          the Libra project. But they want the right technology and the right frameworks before allowing this, to make
          sure that every new member is compliant with the necessary regulatory frameworks (no one wants ISIL as a
          member).</p>
        <h2><strong>Where’s Facebook in All This?</strong></h2>
        <p>So we already know that Facebook created Libra and that they have one vote as a member of the Libra
          Association. They also probably have a good bunch of Libra Investment Tokens that will generate nice money if
          Libra Coins are used by millions, if not billions of people, and the Reserve has positive yields on their
          cash-like assets.<br /></p>
        <p>But that’s not where the story ends and of course it’s not. Zuckerberg is smart. He wants to position
          Facebook as a leader in the financial industry, because he believes things can be done better. And they
          definitely can be. Contrary to most other people’s opinions, I don’t believe Zuckerberg has bad intentions.
          However, it’s entirely possible for Libra to accidentally take a turn for the worse, which is why all
          governments around the world are so cautious about this initiative.<br /></p>
        <figure style="max-width:80%" class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image">
          <div><img
              src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8cabf5226ebd6d1c477f7d/5ec6077810ee74f148abbf25_Oops%20Little%20Mistake.jpg"
              alt="Mark Zuckerberg tweet" /></div>
          <figcaption><em>Oops</em>‍<br /></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Facebook is involved in the Libra project in two other main ways. Firstly, it’s working on a cryptocurrency
          wallet called <a href="https://www.novi.com/" target="_blank">Novi</a> (rebranded from . All those people who
          want to use Libra Coins will need a place to store it. That place can be N, a custodial wallet designed with
          user experience and privacy in mind. This means that Facebook won’t be able to use their data for ad targeting
          through Nwon’tbe able to figure out who someone is based on their publicly visible transactions.<br /></p>
        <p>The Novi wallet will be built into WhatsApp, Messenger, and Facebook itself, which leads me to the second big
          way Facebook is involved. It’s the only company in the Association (and indeed the only company in the world)
          that has access to <a
            href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/"
            target="_blank">2.6 billion people</a>. No other company comes close.<br /></p>
        <p>So anything that Facebook builds will reach an enormous number of people almost automatically. This gives
          them a ton of soft power. Although other people will eventually be able to build their own Libra wallet, it’s
          unlikely that they’ll ever be able to compete with Facebook’s Novi.<br /></p>
        <p>Similarly, while Facebook might only have one vote in the association, their access to billions of people
          gives them enough soft power that other members of the Association might follow whatever Facebook decides to
          vote on. After all, without access to those billions, Libra won’t succeed, and every Association member wants
          to see a positive return on their investment.</p>
        <h2><strong>In Conclusion</strong></h2>
        <p>Everything considered, I lean in favor of Libra. It seems to be built in such a way that it can provide a
          fundamental layer for financial innovation that benefits the unbanked and underbanked. There also seems to be
          enough government scrutiny to keep Facebook in check and to make sure it doesn’t accumulate too much power too
          rapidly through Libra.<br /></p>
        <p>It’s hard to say whether the project will succeed though, as countries might find the whole endeavor too
          risky altogether. France and Germany have already agreed to <a
            href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-cryptocurrency-france-german-idUSKCN1VY1XU"
            target="_blank">block Libra</a>, for example. But even if the Libra project doesn’t succeed, it has made
          countries and banks anxious enough to work hard on making their financial service cheaper, faster, and more
          accessible.<br /></p>
