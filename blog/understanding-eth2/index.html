        <p>We are only weeks away from the official launch of Ethereum 2.0. It’s been a long journey. Ethereum 1.0
          launched in 2015 and has had several upgrades since, but none of them come close to the changes Eth2 will
          introduce. <br /></p>
        <p>It’s high time, too. Ethereum is by far the most popular blockchain platform to build on and, because it can
          only support 15 transactions per second (tps) on average, has seen serious network congestion as a result.
          Particularly because of the popularity of <a href="https://tdmoor.com/blog/demystifying-defi"
            target="_blank">DeFi</a>, Ethereum users have experienced high transaction fees and slow confirmation times,
          to the point where certain decentralized applications became virtually unusable.<br /></p>

        <p>Eth2 promises to alleviate, if not entirely eliminate, these problems. This article will talk about the three
          biggest changes of Eth2, when they&#x27;ll be rolled out, and why Eth1 will remain important for a long time
          still.<br /></p>
        <h2>The Biggest Changes of Ethereum 2.0</h2>
        <h3>From Proof of Work to Proof of Stake</h3>
        <p>Every blockchain needs a <a href="https://tdmoor.com/blog/understanding-blockchain-technology"
            target="_blank">consensus mechanism</a>. It’s how people come to an agreement on the validity of the
          information in blocks. The two most popular blockchains, Bitcoin and Ethereum, use a consensus mechanism
          called Proof of Work (PoW), where miners use computing power to find the key to a cryptographic puzzle.<br />
        </p>
        <p>PoW has been a good and safe consensus mechanism, but it has serious problems. One of them is the amount of
          electricity it consumes. Bitcoin and Ethereum have <a
            href="https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/how-many-bitcoins-are-there/" target="_blank">hundreds of
            thousands of miners</a> all racing to find the key as fast they can, their devices drawing electricity from
          grids around the world. Bitcoin already consumes <a
            href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-48853230#:~:text=Currently%2C%20the%20tool%20estimates%20that,nuclear%20power%20plants%20at%20once."
            target="_blank">as much electricity as Switzerland</a>, and that number is only ever going up.<br /></p>
        <p>Another problem is the fact that anyone with 51% of computing power could technically corrupt the chain. This
          is particularly possible if the price of Bitcoin drops and mining will stop being profitable for many miners.
          Only a few powerful mining groups will remain, leading to a more centralized blockchain and possibly a 51%
          attack.<br /></p>
        <p>That’s why most newer blockchains now run on Proof of Stake (PoS) or some version thereof. Eth2 will also
          move to PoS as its consensus mechanism. If you have 32 ETH (approx. $10,900 at the time of writing) you can
          become an Ethereum validator, validating information in Ethereum blocks. You need to stake that ETH (lock it
          up) and run a validator node, which can be any consumer-grade machine (instead of specialized hardware like
          you’d need for PoW).<a href="https://twitter.com/RyanSAdams/status/1283202511860637696">‍</a>‍</p>
        <figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image">
          <div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8cabf5226ebd6d1c477f7d/5f75b303ed373f5771579a67_32%20ETH.jpg"

          <figcaption>I have <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanSAdams/status/1283202511860637696" target="_blank">steaked
              my ETH</a></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The more ETH you stake, the more likely you’ll be chosen to propose a block. Once you’ve proposed a block, at
          least 128 other validators will need to attest that the information in your block is correct. Validating
          blocks will bring rewards ranging from <a
            href="https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/ethereum-2.0/eth-2.0-economics/" target="_blank">1.8% to 18%
            APR</a> (proposed rates).<br /></p>
        <p>There’s a lot more to PoS on Ethereum, but that’s the gist of it. It will drastically reduce the energy
          consumption of Ethereum and will be one part of the puzzle to eventually help Ethereum scale to <a
            href="https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/buterin-ethereum-2-0-will-scale-to-100000-tps-in-phase-1"
            target="_blank">100,000 transactions per second</a> (according to Ethereum’s founder Vitalik Buterin).
          That’s a somewhat doubtful claim, considering even Visa can only theoretically process 24,000 tps, but moving
          to PoS should help speed up Ethereum from its snail-paced 15 tps.</p>
        <h3>Introducing Shard Chains</h3>
        <p>Another upgrade that will significantly improve Ethereum’s network capacity are shard chains. Eth1 is one
          long blockchain. Eth2 will be at least 64 parallel blockchains, called shards, that each take up a portion of
          the network’s processing work. No longer will miners/validators need to download, compute, store, and read all
          of Ethereum’s transactions. Instead, validators will only need to concern themselves with their particular
          shard.<br /></p>
        <p>All these separate shards are connected via <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/the-beacon-chain/"
            target="_blank">the Beacon Chain</a>. This is a chain that has links to all shards and that stores the
          addresses of all validators, the state of each validator, and block attestations. The Beacon Chain uses the <a
            href="https://blockgeeks.com/guides/ethereum-casper/" target="_blank">Casper PoS protocol</a> to finalize
          blocks and make them irreversible, and will also serve as a bridge between Eth1 and 2.</p>
        <h3>From EVM to eWASM</h3>
        <p>Creating a decentralized application on Eth1 requires you to learn Solidity, its programming language for
          writing smart contracts. What you write is Solidity is compiled into a low-level machine instruction called an
          opcode that the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) uses to execute tasks.<br /></p>
        <p>But the EVM is slow and limited in its capabilities. That’s why Eth2 will introduce the Ethereum WebAssembly
          (eWASM). Developers will be able to program in many different languages and will be able to execute their code
          in modern browsers. This means that the barrier of entry for programming on Ethereum will lower significantly.
        </p>
        <h2>The Gradual Rollout of Eth2</h2>
        <p>All the above are exciting changes that will significantly improve the Ethereum blockchain and its
          corresponding ecosystem, but we’re nowhere near seeing these deployed yet. As it stands, we’re close to Phase
          0 of Eth2. This means that you can soon deposit ETH from Eth1 to Eth2 and start staking. This phase is meant
          to accumulate the required 524,000 ETH (the minimum the chain needs to get going) and to stabilize the
          network.<br /></p>
        <p>Phase 1 will be implemented in 2021. This phase will introduce the shard chains we spoke about above. All
          that these shard chains will do at this point is verify data. There won’t be any actual transactions nor smart
          contracts yet.<br /></p>
        <p>Phase 2 has no defined timeline, but it will unlock the ability to build applications on Eth2. By this time,
          PoW should be entirely phased out and Ethereum will have moved to eWASM. This is Eth2 at its full
          functionality. There’s a Phase 3 as well, which will see further upgrades. Vitalik Buterin has a <a
            href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1240365047421054976" target="_blank">roadmap of the next
            five to ten years</a> on Ethereum that might give you an idea of what’s down the line.</p>
        <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Ethereum 2.0 is exciting, but it’s still a long way before it will become practically usable. I can’t help
          but feel worried for Ethereum about this, because other blockchains platforms such as <a
            href="https://cosmos.network/" target="_blank">Cosmos</a>, <a href="https://polkadot.network/"
            target="_blank">Polkadot</a>, and <a href="https://near.org/" target="_blank">NEAR</a> already have some
          version of all the above features, and they’re up and running already. At this point, Ethereum’s moat is its
          ecosystem, but how long will that last with today’s gas fees and transaction times? </p>
        <p>We&#x27;ll be stuck with Eth1 for a good while yet, which is why it&#x27;s still important to pay attention
          to Eth1 upgrades, called Ethereum Improvement Upgrades (EIPs), as well as projects that aim to improve
          Eth1&#x27;s scalability, such as <a href="https://loopring.org/" target="_blank">Loopring</a> and <a
            href="https://matic.network/" target="_blank">Matic Network</a>).</p>
